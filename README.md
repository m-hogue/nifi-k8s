# nifi-k8s
This is a really basic, quick and dirty nifi k8s deployment yaml and is very much a work in progress.

## Components
### Docker Registry
This is an independent Docker Registry used to host images for the k8s Cluster. This is advantageous for hosting either _only_ images you need for this k8s cluster or for images you wish to keep private to your cluster and not be posted in a public Docker Registry.

### Nifi Registry
The k8s configuration to deploy a single NiFi Registry. This is used to stage changes to the NiFi canvas and deploy them to production.

### Parasite
Parasite is a nickname for single node NiFi instances. These will host processor groups deployed via the NiFi Registry. The expectation is that there will be a large variety of parasite groups (ingest, conversion, enrichment, etc.). This is the k8s configuration for parasites.

### Prometheus
The k8s configuration to deploy prometheus and grafana, which are scraping metrics from all of the other components.

### NiFi
The `nifi.yaml` and `nifi-rook-ceph.yaml` are k8s configurations for a driver NiFi that would be hosted in a staging environment, for example. 

### NiFi Operator (TODO)
This currently absent component will be responsible for detecting staged changes in the NiFi Registry, provisioning parasites satisfying those changes if necessary, and deploying the changes to the production k8s cluster.

## Setup
This guide assumes the following:
- There is a persistent volume provisioner that supports the storage class "local-path" installed in k8s
- There is an ingress controller installed in k8s

These are the steps I followed to set this up:

1. Install k3s since it bundles all of the necessary pieces to run Kubernetes, such as a container runtime (containerd) and ingress controller (traefik)
2. Download Rancher's local-path-provisioner and deploy in k3s

    a. Instructions: https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner  
    b. By default, the local-path-provisioner writes all state to `/opt/local-path-provisioner`. If you don't want that, you can change it by pulling the yaml and editing the `config.json` at the bottom of the file.  
3. deploy the nifi.yaml in this repo

    a. `kubectl create -f ./nifi-k8s/nifi.yaml`  
    b. By default, traefik routes everything via port 80 and 443 for http and https, respectively. Nifi's ingress config specifies the host as `nifi`, so the URL to access the NiFi UI will be `http://nifi:80/nifi`

### Known Issues:
- `nifi.yaml` uses a local-path persistent volume forces any nifi running to use the same directory for state. This means running > 1 NiFi will be a problem. The intent is to use Rook long term for persistence.
- Neither yaml in this repo currently supports running multiple nifis. Since the repositories are independent and requests are round-robined between the nifis, running more than one doesn't currently work.

### Extras:
1. By default, the traefik's dashboard isn't enabled in k3s. You can enable it be adding `dashboard.enabled: "true"` to the file `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/traefik.yaml`. 

    a. k3s will automatically redeploy traefik with the updated configuration. You can watch this happen via `watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`  
    b. You can find where the dashboard is running via `kubectl get endpoints -n kube-system`

## TODO:
1. Investigate alternate persistent volume provisioners. Possibly leverage a storage orchestrator such as Rook
2. Depending on the persistent volume provisioning, may want to impement node affinity rules to have some sense of locality for volume mounts and running pods
3. Deploy Apache NiFi Registry, split the graph into sub-graphs, and have k8s services hosting a sub-graph
